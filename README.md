# BezierInfo-2: a dev repository

This is the development repository for ["A Primer on BÃ©zier Curves"](https://pomax.github.io.bezierinfo), itself hosted as https://pomax.github.io/BezierInfo-2/

This is the new codebased for the primer, being a pure HTML/CSS/Vanilla-JS tech stack - the old version can be found on the [2016-react](https://github.com/Pomax/BezierInfo-2/tree/2016-react) branch

Work is still underway on this new version, see https://github.com/Pomax/BezierInfo-2/issues/257 for the current task list.

## Building everything

Use the latest Node v14, with all dependencies installed via `npm install`. Note that [node-canvas](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canva) has [special instructions](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas/wiki/Installation:-Windows) because it's going to have to compile itself (however, JPEG support is not needed for this project).

- The general single-build-pass command is simply `npm start`
- Continuous development is `npm test`

#### Specialised commands:

- `regenerate` runs a build followed by running `prettier` on the final .html files, as well as `link-checker` to make sure there are no dead links in the content.

#### Even more specialized commands:

Please see the package.json `"scripts"` section for the full list of commands. Most of these are just build chain steps, and running them on their own basically makes no sense.

## Weird personal dependencies?

There are a number of dependencies that are pulled from my own forks of projects, because they included patches (either by myself or others) that fix problems or shortcomings that have not been merged into upstream yet, or have been merged in but not released as a version that can be pulled down from npm yet.
